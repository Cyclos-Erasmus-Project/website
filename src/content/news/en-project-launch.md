The CYCLOS (Youth Cycling for Inclusion) project has officially launched, marking the beginning of an exciting 30-month journey to promote social inclusion of disadvantaged young people through cycling.

## A European Partnership

Funded by the ERASMUS+ Programme, CYCLOS brings together four partner organizations from across Europe:

- **FLVS** (France) - Lead Partner
- **ASSOC** (Romania)
- **AFIS** (Austria)
- **Computer Solutions SA** (Greece)

## Project Objectives

The project aims to:

1. Promote social inclusion of disadvantaged youth through cycling activities
2. Raise environmental awareness and encourage greener mobility choices
3. Help young people become more autonomous and independent
4. Develop professional tools for youth workers

## What's Next

Over the coming months, the partnership will work on developing educational materials, organizing practical cycling sessions, and creating a digital learning platform to support youth inclusion across Europe.

Stay tuned for more updates as the project progresses!
